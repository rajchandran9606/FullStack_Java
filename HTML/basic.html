		 The layout of texts in European languages has changed considerably since the Middle Ages, when the paragraph was not a consistently organized unit of PROSE, and prose was not a 
		 highly developed form of writing. The development of PRINTING in the 15c encouraged the use of paragraphs as blocks of lines that could be manipulated easily by the printer and 
		 helped break up the appearance of page after page of print. However, balance in the presentation of lines of print, whole pages, and the effect of the message has been a minor 
		 consideration in teaching COMPOSITION and in the development of print. Nonetheless, the general view has arisen that just as a chapter (with or without a heading) is a section 
		 in the progression of an argument or a story, so within the chapter a paragraph (with or without a subheading) is part of the same orderly progression.

	By and large, until the 19c, paragraphs tended to be long and to consist of PERIODIC SENTENCES, one period sometimes taking up a paragraph running over one or more pages. 
		 In manuals of instruction, however, especially where sections have been logically ordered (and numbered), paragraphs have tended to be shorter. The scripts of PROSE plays have 
		 always had marked-off sections opening with characters' names (on a par with verse drama). In novels and other works of fiction, along with the increasing use of separated-off 
		 DIALOGUE (similar to the style of scripts), 19c writers reduced the lengths of their paragraphs, a process that has continued in the 20c, particularly in journalism, advertisements, 
		 and publicity materials, where paragraphs are often short and built out of sentence fragments. Writers of fiction often use the same effect to present swift action, changes in thinking, and the like.
